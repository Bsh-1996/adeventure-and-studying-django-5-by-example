Django Blog Project
This is a personal blog application built with Django, showcasing advanced Django features such as custom tags, template filters, full-text search, and third-party integration for tagging and recommendations.

Features
Tagging System: Integrated django-taggit to allow easy tagging of blog posts.
Post Recommendations: Generated recommendations based on post similarities.
Custom Template Tags and Filters: Created custom tags and filters to extend Djangoâ€™s templating functionality.
SEO Optimization: Created a sitemap and RSS feed for search engine crawlers and users.
Search Engine: Integrated PostgreSQL full-text search for blog posts, including stemming and ranking of search results.
Pagination: Added pagination to the post list view to improve performance and usability.
Project Status
This project is a work in progress. While many features have been implemented and are fully functional, some advanced features have not yet been completed, including:

Switching Database to PostgreSQL: The project currently uses SQLite as the database, but the transition to PostgreSQL has not been implemented yet.
Full-Text Search: The advanced search features, such as stemming and trigram similarity, are planned but not yet fully implemented.
Search View: The search view for retrieving posts by keywords is still under development.
